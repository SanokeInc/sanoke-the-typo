# Sanoke Developer Guide
**Sanoke** is a simple Match 3 game that can (and will) be easily extended.
## Overview
The core game of **Sanoke** consists of 5 main components, `Sanoke`, `Assets`, `GameScreen`, `Board`, and `Unit`.
`Sanoke` acts as a facade, as well as provide the sprite batches and font bitmaps. `Assets` are where all assets will be stored and loaded from. `GameScreen` handles the displaying as well as the handling of user input. `Board` is where the logic of the game occurs, and `Unit` represents a single unit.
